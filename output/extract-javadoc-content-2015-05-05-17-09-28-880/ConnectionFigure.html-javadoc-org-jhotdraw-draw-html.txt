Checks if two figures can be connected using this Connection Figure Implement this to constrain the allowed connections between figures Checks if this Connection Figure can be attached to the provided start figure This used to provide early feedback to the user when he/she creates new connection Checks if the Connection Figure connects the same figures F I X M E - What we need this for? Sets the start point Sets the point Sets the specified point Gets the point count Returns the specified point Gets the start point Specified by get Start Point Figure See Also Figure basic Set Bounds awt geom Point2 awt geom Point2 Gets the point Specified by get End Point Figure See Also Figure basic Set Bounds awt geom Point2 awt geom Point2 Gets the start figure of the connection This convenience for doing get Start Connector get Owner and handling cases Gets the figure of the connection This convenience for doing get End Connector get Owner and handling cases Get Liner which encapsulated lineout algorithm for this figure Typically Liner accesses the child components of this figure and arranges their graphical presentation Returns lineout strategy used by this figure A lineout algorithm used to define how the child components should be laid out relation to each other The task for lineouting the child components for presentation delegated to Liner which can be plugged runtime Set Liner which encapsulated lineout algorithm for this figure Typically Liner accesses the child components of this figure and arranges their graphical presentation It good idea to set the Liner the initialize it can be recreated if Graphical Composite Figure read and restored from Storable Input stream Parameters new Value - encapsulation of lineout algorithm
