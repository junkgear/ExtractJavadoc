The Graphics2 to draw to Gets the layer of the figure The layer used to determine the z-ordering of figure inside of drawing Figures with higher layer number are drawn after figures with lower number The z-order of figures within the same layer determined by the sequence the figures were added to drawing Figures added later to drawn after figures which have been added before If figure changes its layer it must fire Figure Listener figure Changed event to its figure listeners F I X M E - Replace value by Layer A Figure only drawn by Drawing and by Composite Figure if it visible Layouter's should ignore invisible figures too Changes the visible state of the Figure The Figure fires Figure Listener figure Changed and Undoable Edit Listener undoable Edit Happened if this operation changed its visible state Sets the logical bounds of the figure and of its decorator figure This used by Tool's which create new Figure and by Tool's which connect Figure to another Figure This basic operation which does not fire events Parameters start - the start point of the bounds - the point of the bounds See Also get Bounds Returns the start point of the bounds See Also basic Set Bounds awt geom Point2 awt geom Point2 Returns the point of the bounds See Also basic Set Bounds awt geom Point2 awt geom Point2 Returns the logical bounds of the figure Rectangle The logical bounds are used by some Handle for adjusting the figure Returns the drawing bounding box of the figure and of its decorator figure This takes line width line caps and other decorations into account Note get Draw Bounds must include the logical bounds of the figure The preferred size used by Layouter to determine the preferred size of Figure For most Figure's this the same the dimensions by get Bounds Gets data which can be used to restore the shape of the figure after basic Transform has been applied to it See Also basic Transform Affine Transform Restores the shape of the figure to previously stored state Transforms the shape of the Figure Transformations using precision arithmethics are inherently lossy operations Therefore it recommended to use get Restore Data restore To to provide lossless undo/redo functionality After the transform has finished the bounds of the decorator figure are changed to match the transformed bounds of the figure This basic operation which does not fire events Parameters tx - The transformation Sets attribute of the figure Attribute Key and semantics are defined by the implementing the Figure On attribute change the Figure fires Figure Listener figure Attribute Changed Undoable Edit Listener undoable Edit Happened If the shape affected by attribute change Figure Listener figure Changed fired too Sets attribute of the figure without firing events Attribute Key and semantics are defined by the implementing the Figure Use Attribute Key set for typesafe access to this See Also Attribute Key set org jhotdraw draw Figure T Gets attribute from the Figure Use Attribute Key get for typesafe access to this Returns Returns the attribute value If the Figure does not have attribute with the specified key key get Default Value See Also Attribute Key get org jhotdraw draw Figure Returns view to all attributes of this figure By convention unmodifiable map Returns if the user can manipulate this figure If this operation Tool's should not interact with this figure Checks if point contained by the figure This used for hit testing by Tool's Creates handles used to manipulate the figure Parameters detail Level - The detail level of the handles Usually this 0 for bounding box handles and 1 for point handles Returns Collection of handles See Also Handle Returns cursor for the specified location Returns collection of Action's for the specified location The collection may contain entries These entries are used interpreted separators the popup menu Actions can use the property Figure ACTION_SUBMENU to specify submenu Returns specialized tool for the specified location Returns if no specialized tool available Returns tooltip for the specified location Checks if this Figure can be connected Gets connector for this figure the given location A figure can have different connectors different locations Parameters - the location of the connector prototype - The prototype used to create connection or if unknown This allows for specific connectors for different connection figures Gets compatible connector If the provided connector part of this figure the connector If the provided connector part of another figure connector with the same semantics for this figure Return if no compatible connector available Sets whether the connectors should be visible for the specified courting connector Connectors can be optionally visible Returns if this figure draws its connectors Checks whether the given figure contained this figure A figure includes itself Returns the figure that contains the given point Returns decompositon of figure into its parts A figure considered part of itself Returns clone of the figure After cloning collection of figures the Connection Figures contained this collection still connect to the original figures instead of to the clones Using This operation and providing map which maps from the original collection of figures to the new collection connections can be remapped to the new figures Informs figure that it has been added to the specified drawing The figure must inform all Figure Listeners that it has been added Informs figure that it has been removed from the specified drawing The figure must inform all Figure Listeners that it has been removed Informs that Figure about to change its shape will Change and changed are typically used pairs before and after invoking one or multiple basic-methods the Figure Informs that Figure changed its shape This fires Figure Listener figure Changed event for the current display bounds of the figure See Also will Change Informs that Figure has invalidated its display area and needs to be drawn Fires Figure Listener area Invalidated event Fires Figure Listener figure Request Remove event Handles drop Parameters - The location of the mouse event dropped Figures - The dropped figures view - The drawing view which the source of the mouse event Returns Returns if the figures should snap back to the location they were dragged from Handles mouse click Parameters - The location of the mouse event evt - The mouse event view - The drawing view which the source of the mouse event Returns Returns if the figure consumed the mouse click Adds listener for Figure Event's Removes listener for Figure Event's Adds listener for Undoable Edit events Removes listener for Undoable Edit events Sets decorator figure Set this to if no decorator desired The decorator will use the same logical bounds this figure It will be drawn when the figure drawn Gets the decorator figure
