the with the value zero meaning any number of cols - the columns with the value zero meaning any number of columns Creates grid layout with the specified number of and columns All components the layout are given equal size In addition the horizontal and vertical gaps are set to the specified values Horizontal gaps are placed the left and right edges and between each of the columns Vertical gaps are placed the top and bottom edges and between each of the One but not both of and cols can be zero which means that any number of can be placed or column All Vertical Grid Layout constructors defer to this one Parameters - the with the value zero meaning any number of cols - the columns with the value zero meaning any number of columns hgap - the horizontal gap vgap - the vertical gap Throws lang Illegal Argument Exception - if the value of both and cols set to zero Gets the number of this layout Returns the number of this layout Since J K1 1 Sets the number of this layout to the specified value Parameters - the number of this layout Throws lang Illegal Argument Exception - if the value of both and cols set to zero Since J K1 1 Gets the number of columns this layout Returns the number of columns this layout Since J K1 1 Sets the number of columns this layout to the specified value Setting the number of columns has no affect the layout if the number of specified by constructor or by the set Rows non-zero In that case the number of columns displayed the layout determined by the total number of components and the number of specified Parameters cols - the number of columns this layout Throws lang Illegal Argument Exception - if the value of both and cols set to zero Since J K1 1 Gets the horizontal gap between components Returns the horizontal gap between components Since J K1 1 Sets the horizontal gap between components to the specified value Parameters hgap - the horizontal gap between components Since J K1 1 Gets the vertical gap between components Returns the vertical gap between components Since J K1 1 Sets the vertical gap between components to the specified value Parameters vgap - the vertical gap between components Since J K1 1 Adds the specified component with the specified to the layout Specified by add Layout Component awt Layout Manager Parameters - the of the component comp - the component to be added Removes the specified component from the layout Specified by remove Layout Component awt Layout Manager Parameters comp - the component to be removed Determines the preferred size of the container argument using this grid layout The preferred width of grid layout the largest preferred width of any of the components the container times the number of columns plus the horizontal padding times the number of columns plus one plus the left and right insets of the target container The preferred height of grid layout the largest preferred height of any of the components the container times the number of plus the vertical padding times the number of plus one plus the top and bottom insets of the target container Specified by preferred Layout Size awt Layout Manager Parameters parent - the container which to the layout Returns the preferred dimensions to lay out the subcomponents of the specified container Determines the minimum size of the container argument using this grid layout The minimum width of grid layout the largest minimum width of any of the components the container times the number of columns plus the horizontal padding times the number of columns plus one plus the left and right insets of the target container The minimum height of grid layout the largest minimum height of any of the components the container times the number of plus the vertical padding times the number of plus one plus the top and bottom insets of the target container Specified by minimum Layout Size awt Layout Manager Parameters parent - the container which to the layout Returns the minimum dimensions needed to lay out the subcomponents of the specified container Lays out the specified container using this layout This reshapes the components the specified target container order to satisfy the constraints of the Vertical Grid Layout The grid layout manager determines the size of individual components by dividing the free space the container into equal-sized portions according to the number of and columns the layout The container's free space equals the container's size minus any insets and any specified horizontal or vertical gap All components grid layout are given the same size Specified by layout Container awt Layout Manager Parameters parent - the container which to the layout See Also Container Container Layout Returns the representation of this grid layout's values Overrides to String lang Object Returns representation of this grid layout
